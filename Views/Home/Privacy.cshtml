    <p>Your privacy is important to us. This application does not store or share any personal data you enter. All inputs for single or batch scoring are processed in-memory and not persisted to any database or log.</p>

    <p><strong>No personal data collected:</strong> We only use the numeric house attributes (rooms, area, age) to generate price predictions. No identifying information is ever saved.</p>

    <p><strong>Data retention:</strong> Uploaded CSVs are processed on-the-fly and discarded immediately after scoring. Models and metrics are stored only for application functionality.</p>
