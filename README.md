# House Price Predictor

An end-to-end sample demonstrating how to build, tune, and deploy a house price prediction solution using **ML.NET** and **ASP.NET Core MVC**, complete with interactive console, web UI, batch CSV scoring, Docker containerization, and CI/CD automation.

---

## üöÄ Project Highlights

- **ML.NET Pipeline**: Data loading, feature engineering (concatenate, normalization, custom feature), and regression training with the FastTree algorithm.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Automated grid search over `NumberOfTrees` and `LearningRate` using 5-fold cross-validation to identify the best model.
- **Console App**: Interactive CLI for single-sample predictions and batch CSV scoring, saving the best model (`HousePriceModel_Best.zip`).
- **Web App**: ASP.NET Core MVC site with:
  - **Single-input** form for on-the-fly predictions.
  - **Batch CSV upload** and table view of all scored rows.
  - **Model metrics** (R¬≤, RMSE) displayed prominently.
  - **Bootstrap**-styled responsive UI and client-side validation.
  - **Privacy** page with a simple data-handling policy.
- **Docker**: Multi-stage Dockerfile to build and run the MVC app in a lean runtime container. Hosted locally and published to Docker Hub (`atanda01/housepriceweb:latest`).
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds & publishes the Docker image on every push to `main`.

## üõ† Tools & Frameworks

- **.NET 9.0 SDK** & **ML.NET**
- **ASP.NET Core MVC**
- **Bootstrap 5** for styling
- **Docker Desktop** & **Docker Hub**
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD

All development was done on macOS using VS Code or terminal editors; no paid software required.

## üîß Setup & Usage

1. **Clone the repo**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/atanda01/HousePriceWeb.git
   cd HousePriceWeb
   ```

2. **Run locally**:

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   dotnet run
   ```

   Open `https://localhost:5001/` (or the port shown) to access the UI.

3. **Docker**:

   ```bash
   docker build -t housepriceweb:latest .
   docker run -d -p 5054:80 housepriceweb:latest
   ```

   Browse to `http://localhost:5054/`.

4. **CI/CD**: Push changes to `main`; GitHub Actions will rebuild & push to `docker.io/atanda01/housepriceweb:latest`.

## üß† ML.NET Pipeline Overview

```csharp
// 1. Load data
var data = mlContext.Data.LoadFromTextFile<HouseData>("data/housing.csv", hasHeader: true, separatorChar: ',');

// 2. Feature engineering
var pipeline = mlContext.Transforms
    .Concatenate("Features", nameof(HouseData.Rooms), nameof(HouseData.Area), nameof(HouseData.Age))
    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.NormalizeMinMax("Features"))
    .Append(mlContext.Regression.Trainers.FastTree(options));

// 3. Hyperparameter grid search via 5-fold CV
// 4. Train final model on full data
mlContext.Model.Save(finalModel, data.Schema, "HousePriceModel_Best.zip");
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution

*All predicted values are ****approximate**** and intended for demonstration purposes only. Real-world deployment requires more robust data, validation, and domain-specific adjustments.*
